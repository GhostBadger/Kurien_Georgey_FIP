### My topic
Eggs

Ever since I was born. Food was a huge part of my life and I gotta say. I have eaten a lot of eggs during that time. I realized something. Eggs are really versatile. They are used for food in every culture from Africa, Asia, Europe, America, Even in the Arctic Regions, Penguin eggs are sometimes used for food. So what better subject to choose than eggs. I was planning to do spices, but hey when life throws eggs at you take pictures and make a website out of it.
